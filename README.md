# Restaurant_Reviews-using-NLP
Perform Sentiment analysis on Restaurant Reviews using machine learning algorithms.

•	We take Restaurant Reviews dataset which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant.

•	The dataset we taken from Kaggle.com website.

•	Now, we perform Sentiment analysis on Restaurant Reviews using machine learning algorithms.

•	For sentiment analysis, we build a prediction model to predict whether the review on the restaurant is positive or negative.

•	Among three algorithms from Decision Tree, Random forest and Naïve Bayes we select Naïve Bayes algorithm which gives more accuracy of prediction i.e. 70%.

•	Our output was either positive or negative, therefore we used classification algorithms like Naïve Bayes.

•	To build a model and to predict if review is positive or negative, following steps are performed.

a] Importing Dataset
